With a decade of experience under my belt, and graduating from an academy sponsored by Microsoft studying Information Technology, as well for earning several awards as a competitive member of Business Professionals of America, computer science has become very influential in my life. This field is something I am very passionate about, leading me to strive for exponential growth and improvement. I observe like a satellite to learn from the mistakes of others while finding inspiration from those greater than me.

### Give me something to do?

I'm always interested in helping and educating those wanting to become, or be better, programmers, engineers, and computer scientists. Especially those developing with C#. Have a question or stuck on something? Something not working right? Don't know where to begin? Reach out to me and let's figure this out together.
